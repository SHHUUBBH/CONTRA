# Security Notice - API Keys Cleaned

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

**Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### What Happened
GitHub's push protection detected hardcoded API keys in the repository commits. This is a security best practice to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive credentials.

### What Was Done
1. **Removed all hardcoded API keys** from the following files:
   - `.env`
   - `config.py` 
   - `create_env.py`
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`

2. **Cleaned git history** using `git filter-branch` to remove all traces of the API keys from previous commits

3. **Updated .gitignore** to properly ignore `.env` files

4. **Created `.env.example`** as a template for environment variables

### Current Status
‚úÖ **All API keys removed from git history**  
‚úÖ **Repository is now secure**  
‚úÖ **Push protection requirements satisfied**  

### For Local Development

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your actual API keys to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # Replace with your actual API keys
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_actual_news_api_key_here
   STABILITY_API_KEY=your_actual_stability_api_key_here
   ```

3. **The `.env` file is now properly ignored by git** and won't be committed

### For Production Deployment

For Netlify or other cloud deployments, set the environment variables in your platform's environment variable settings, not in code files.

## Security Best Practices Applied

- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in source code
- ‚úÖ Environment variables used for configuration
- ‚úÖ `.env` files properly ignored
- ‚úÖ Example file provided for setup
- ‚úÖ Git history cleaned of sensitive data

Your repository is now secure and follows security best practices! üîê
