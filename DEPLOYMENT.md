# CONTRA - Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-deployment Setup Complete

Your project has been configured for **one-click Netlify deployment**. All necessary fixes have been applied:

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **Netlify Function Updated**: Converted Flask app to work with Netlify Functions
2. **Frontend Configuration**: Removed localhost references, updated API endpoints to `/api/*`
3. **Build Configuration**: Updated `netlify.toml` with proper build commands
4. **File Structure**: Renamed main HTML file to `index.html` for better compatibility
5. **Python Dependencies**: Added runtime.txt for Python version specification

## 🚀 One-Click Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Connect to Git Repository**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign in with your GitHub/GitLab account
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your repository

2. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Build settings are pre-configured:
     - Build command: `cd HOMEPAGE/HOMEPAGE && npm install && pip install -r ../../requirements.txt`
     - Publish directory: `HOMEPAGE/HOMEPAGE`
     - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

ENABLE_CACHE=1
CACHE_TIMEOUT=3600
MAX_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE=100
MAX_DATA_CACHE_SIZE=1000

```

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Wait for the build to complete (this may take 3-5 minutes)
